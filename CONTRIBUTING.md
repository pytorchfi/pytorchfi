# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! :tada: Here are some guidelines to contributing to this repository.

## Github

### Commits

- Start commit message with uppercase letter
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests

### Pull Requests

When initially opening a pull request, please open it in **draft** mode if it still a work in progress, and do not mark it for review. Only open it for review when it is fully finished.

Once you are done implementing the feature, make sure that your code follows the style guide laid out in the README, and all status checks are passing. Fill out the pull request description with as much detail so its clear what changes were made and how it can be tested. Then, mark the pull request as ready for review.

### Issues

When opening an issue, look to make sure that a similar issue has not already been opened.

#### Issue Labels

When creating an issue, add a label for easier classification. Here are a breakdown of the available labels:

| Label name             | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug` :beetle:         | Bug report with the current application on the master branch.                                     |
| `documentation` :book: | An issue with the documentation. This may include incorrect or insufficient information.          |
| `feature` :star2:      | A new feature request for the application. This will be paired with a priority label if accepted. |
